In the aftermath of global financial crisis, it is widely agreed that the conventional tools employed by central banks around the world had proven to be inadequate to deal with the challenges they faced.
It has been more difficult for the public to know what to expect from the central bank policy because of the unusual circumstances of the recent crisis and the unprecedented policy measures required for responding to them. 
Clear mandate about goals and objectives of monetary policy, transparency and anchoring of expectations are the primary principles along the lines of which monetary policy should be conducted by the central banks.
In this paper, I present the argument that nominal GDP targeting is an approach that is consistent with these principles and provides the appropriate amount of liquidity to the economy. 
An approach based on nominal GDP targeting allows for a systematic, transparent and robust monetary system that can produce superior outcomes in a wide variety of conditions, while retaining some of the desirable features of inflation targeting as it has developed over the past two decades.Although is a common understanding that price stability is essential to sustainable economic goal, there is no consensus on whether price stability commands primacy over other goals necessary for monetary stability.
